snort rules


Rule Structure

Header: Defines basic match criteria.
Action: alert, log, pass, drop, reject (e.g., alert triggers an event).
Protocol: TCP, UDP, ICMP.
Source/Destination: IP addresses (e.g., any, home_net), ports.
Direction: -> (one way) or <> (bidirectional).

Body (Options): Specifies inspection details in parentheses ().
msg: The message to display when the rule triggers.
sid: Unique Snort ID for versioning.
rev: Revision number for the rule.
content: Matches specific data in the packet payload (e.g., content:"malware";).
classtype: Categorizes the attack type (e.g., attempted-recon). 

Types of Rule Sets
Community Rules: Free, community-developed.
Registered Rules: Free with registration, better coverage.
Subscriber Rules (Talos): Paid, real-time threat intelligence. 

Example Rule
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"ET EXPLOIT Possible SQL Injection Attempt"; flow:to_server,established; content:"' OR '1'='1"; sid:2010001; rev:1;)
Action: alert (log the event).
Protocol/Direction: tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (TCP traffic to your network on port 80).
Options: msg (SQLi message), flow (established connection), content (looking for ' OR '1'='1'), sid, rev. 

Best Practices
Comment rules for clarity.
Tune rules to reduce false positives.
Use unique SIDs and increment rev for updates.
Test rules in isolation before deployment.
