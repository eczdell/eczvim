✅ Why Prefix a Field with _?
1. Suppress “unused variable/field” warnings

Rust will warn you if a field or variable is never read or used.
If you name the field starting with an underscore, you’re telling the compiler:

“This field might exist for structural reasons but I intentionally don’t use it right now.”

That suppresses the unused‑field warning without other changes.

Example:

pub struct Config {
    pub host: String,
    pub _log_level: String, // avoids unused warning
}
