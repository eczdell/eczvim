🔹 Example (1st-order Markov)

From email data:

Current word	Next word	Probability
I	am	0.4
I	have	0.3
I	will	0.3
am	fine	0.6
am	busy	0.4

So when you type:

“I”

The model predicts:

“am”

“have”

“will”

based on probabilities.

🔹 Higher-order Markov (used in Gmail)

Instead of 1 word, Gmail used n-grams:

Bigram (2 words) → depends on last 1 word

Trigram (3 words) → depends on last 2 words

Example:

P(word3 | word1, word2)


Typing:

“Hope you are”

Prediction:

“doing”, “well”, “free”
------------------------------

🔹 States

Each web page = a state

Example:

Page A → Page B → Page C


Transition probabilities:

P(B | A) = 0.5
P(C | A) = 0.5

🔹 PageRank formula (simplified)
PR(P) = (1 − d)/N + d * Σ(PR(incoming pages) / outgoing links)


Where:

d = damping factor (~0.85)

N = total pages

This computes the steady-state probability of being on a page.
---------------------
Use case	Markov State	Transition
Gmail prediction	Word / phrase	Next word probability
Yahoo Mail	Word sequence	Email language patterns
Google PageRank	Web page	Link clicks
IDS / Logs (your domain 😉)	Event	Next event

You can apply Markov chains to:

Command sequences (normal vs malicious)

Network flow transitions

User behavior profiling

Alert correlation

Example:

Login → Read → Logout (normal)
Login → Read → Download → Exfil (suspicious)
