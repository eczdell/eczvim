📊 Social Media Algorithm Evolution (with Examples)
🟦 2005–2012 — Rules + Markov Chains

What it was

Hand-written rules

Simple probability models (Markov chains)

Mostly chronological feeds

How it worked

IF user follows page → show post
IF post is new → boost
Next action depends on last action (Markov)


Example

If you liked sports, next post likely sports

Email / feed prediction:

P(next_click = sports | last_click = sports) = 0.6


Platforms

Early Facebook

Yahoo Mail

Early Google Search / Gmail

Limit
❌ No deep personalization
❌ Easy to game

🟨 2012–2018 — Logistic Regression (ML Era Begins)

What it was

Statistical machine learning

Weighted features

Score-based ranking

How it worked
Each post gets a score:

Score = w1*likes + w2*comments + w3*clicks − w4*age


Probability model:

P(like | user, post)


Example

Post A: 70% chance you like

Post B: 30% chance you like
→ Show Post A first

Platforms

Facebook News Feed

Twitter ranking

YouTube recommendations

Why it was better
✅ Learns from data
✅ Personalization improves

Limit
❌ Linear relationships only
❌ Can’t understand images/videos deeply

🟥 2018–Now — Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning

What it is

Neural networks

Transformers

Reinforcement learning (reward-based)

How it works
Model predicts:

Watch time
Like
Share
Comment


RL feedback loop:

Show content → Measure engagement → Reward model → Update feed


Example (TikTok)

Show video to 100 users

If watch time > 80% → push to 10,000 users

If strong → goes viral

Platforms

TikTok

Instagram Reels

YouTube Shorts

Facebook modern feed

Why it dominates
✅ Understands video/audio/text
✅ Adapts in real time
✅ Extremely personalized

Limit
❌ Addictive
❌ Hard to explain (black box)
